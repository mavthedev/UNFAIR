A quiz game where players dont know how many points they get, or if they are negative

Before every game, players choose what quiz they want their questions to come from, it really doesnâ€™t matter if they make a 1 question quiz to cheat or not beacause they still have a chance to get all negative points.
After each correct question, the player has the option to either keep the points for themselves, or give them to the other player, if the amount is -5 and they choose to keep, they loose 5. if they choose give, the other player looses 5.
Players cannot reach negative points, if they loose points while at 0, the other player gains that many points





Players have XP/Levels they earn every time they play, each game earns 50 + points * 5
